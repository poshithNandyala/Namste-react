# Differences Between JSX and HTML

JSX (JavaScript XML) and HTML (HyperText Markup Language) share similarities in syntax but differ significantly in functionality and usage, particularly within the context of React development. Below are the key differences:

## 1. **Tag Closure**

- **JSX**: Requires all tags to be closed. For instance, `<img>` must be written as `<img src="cat.jpg" />`.
- **HTML**: Allows certain tags to be self-closing without a slash, such as `<img src="cat.jpg">`[1].

## 2. **Attribute Naming**

- **JSX**: Uses camelCase for attribute names. For example, `class` becomes `className`, and `onclick` becomes `onClick`.

  ```jsx
  <button onClick={myFunction}>Log in</button>
  ```
  
- **HTML**: Uses standard attribute names directly, such as `class` and `onclick`[1].

## 3. **JavaScript Expressions**

- **JSX**: Allows embedding JavaScript expressions within curly braces `{}`. This enables dynamic content rendering.

  ```jsx
  <div>{1 + 1}</div>
  ```
  
- **HTML**: Does not support JavaScript expressions directly; any dynamic behavior typically requires separate scripts[1].

## 4. **Style Attributes**

- **JSX**: Requires styles to be specified as an object with camelCase property names.

  <div style={{ boxShadow: '1px 3px 1px grey', color: 'blue' }}>Hello</div>
  
- **HTML**: Styles can be defined as a single string of CSS properties.

  ```html
  <div style="box-shadow: 1px 3px 1px grey; color: blue;">Hello</div>
  ```
  
## 5. **Comments**

- **JSX**: Comments are written within curly braces and use JavaScript syntax.

  {/*This is a comment*/}
  
- **HTML**: Comments are written using the standard HTML comment syntax.

  <!-- This is a comment -->
  
## 6. **Rendering Logic**

- **JSX**: Combines markup with JavaScript logic, making it easier to render dynamic components.
- **HTML**: Serves primarily as a static markup language without built-in logic capabilities[2].

### Summary

While JSX resembles HTML in structure, it is fundamentally different in its requirements and capabilities, particularly in how it integrates with JavaScript for dynamic rendering. JSX serves as a powerful tool for building user interfaces in React, allowing developers to write more expressive and manageable code compared to traditional HTML[5].
